## Next Steps
The following next steps need to be taken with this project:
1.  Create a registration.html page that inputs the users name, date of birth and address and then passes this to a register_user function in python that stores this in the database.  You will need to update the structure of the database using DB Browser.
2.  Update the log_the_user_in function so that it uses the user name to retrieve all the users details and displays them on the profile.html page
### Extensions
3.  Add validation to the registration.html page
4.  Add validation to the database schema and use try except to catch these errors in the app.py file
5.  Add a profile picture to the registration page
